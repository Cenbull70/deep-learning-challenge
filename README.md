# Enhanced Deep Learning Model Performance: Adjusted to Match Notebook
## Introduction
Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, seeks a machine learning model to identify funding applicants with the highest probability of success. The uploaded notebook develops and optimizes a neural network for this binary classification task, leveraging structured preprocessing, model building, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Findings
### Data Preprocessing

1) Target Variable:

-   IS_SUCCESSFUL serves as the target variable, indicating whether funding was utilized effectively.
2) Features:

- Key features include:
    - AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.
3) Dropped Columns:

- Identification columns EIN and NAME were removed as they are not predictive.
4) Binning:

- Rare categories in APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION were grouped under the label "Other" to reduce noise.
5) Encoding and Scaling:

- Categorical variables were one-hot encoded using pd.get_dummies.
- Features were scaled using StandardScaler.
## Model Development

1) Initial Model:

- A neural network with:
    - Two hidden layers:
        - Layer 1: 80 neurons, ReLU activation.
        - Layer 2: 30 neurons, ReLU activation.
    - Output layer: 1 neuron, Sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- This structure was chosen to balance model complexity with generalization.
2) Initial Results:

- Model performance: 73% accuracy.
## Optimization Attempts

1) Increasing Neurons and Epochs:

- Added neurons and increased epochs to allow the model more learning capacity and training time.
- Outcome: No significant improvement; accuracy remained at 73%.
2) Adding Hidden Layers:

- Introduced additional layers to capture deeper patterns.
- Outcome: The model plateaued at 73% accuracy.
3) Trying Different Activation Functions:

- Tested alternative activation functions like tanh.
- Outcome: Performance did not improve beyond 73%.
4) Hyperparameter Tuning:

- Utilized a hyperparameter tuner to systematically test configurations (e.g., number of layers, neurons, activation functions, epochs).
- Outcome: The tuner identified no configuration surpassing 73% accuracy.
## Conclusion and Next Steps 
The deep learning model consistently achieved 73% accuracy, below the target of 75%. To enhance performance, consider:

1) Expanding the Dataset:
- Collect additional examples to improve model generalization.
2) Advanced Data Cleaning:
- Address outliers and missing data more effectively.
3) Exploring Alternative Algorithms:
- Test methods like Random Forest to gain feature importance insights.
4) Feature Engineering:
- Focus on the most informative attributes.
5) Addressing Bias and Outliers:
- Employ outlier removal and stratified sampling.
6) Binning Continuous Variables:
-Simplify relationships by grouping continuous variables.

By iteratively applying these strategies, the model's accuracy can be improved for better predictions.
